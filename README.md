# House-Sales-in-King-County-USA
In this project I was tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. 
In this project I analyzed and predicted housing prices using attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on.
I imported a dataset which contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015 into my notebook. In this project i wrangled through the dataset and discovered missing values in 2 columns, which I quickly corrected by doing the average of each column and replacing the missing values with the mean.
Followed with data exploration where a came up with box plot to compare houses prices of houses with waterfront and without, check for linear regression fit for square feet, also checked correlation to the price for attributes all using python.
I proceeded to develop a model to determine the relationship my value ‘price’ have to the other attributes in the dataset.
